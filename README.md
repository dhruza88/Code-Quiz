# Code-Quiz

in module 4 we were tasked with full development of a code quiz taking in objects from an array and populating the question field, the answer field, and validating the corect answer.

This was an extremely in depth assignment. Calling for the development of multiple functions, creating an array of objects, assigning attributes to those objects and being able to call them for various different functions.

I was tasked with developing a timer that began on a button click, coinciding with the fact if a user choose a wrong answer it would deduct time from the timer.

This module encompassed alot of java script elements such as jquery selectors, elementByID selectors, being able to choose from either ID's, class's, or just a single reference. This was truly showing you how to grab different aspects of an object and manipulate them to do what you want them to.

i was tasked with using local storage to be able to store High Scores and user names to be able to display them on the high score sheet once completing a game.
